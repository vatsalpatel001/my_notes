            <div class="answer">
                <p><b>Constraints in SQL are rules defined for the data columns in a table.</b> They are used to limit
                    the type of data that can be inserted or updated in a table. Common types of constraints include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>NOT NULL: Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.</li>
                    <li>UNIQUE: Ensures that all values in a column are different.</li>
                    <li>PRIMARY KEY: A combination of NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
                    </li>
                    <li>FOREIGN KEY: Ensures referential integrity between two tables.</li>
                    <li>CHECK: Ensures that all values in a column satisfy certain conditions.</li>
                    <li>DEFAULT: Provides a default value for a column when none is specified.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="answer">
                <p><b>A primary key is a constraint in SQL that uniquely identifies each record in a table.</b> It must
                    contain unique values, and no NULL values are allowed. A primary key is implemented using the
                    PRIMARY KEY constraint. Typically, it is applied to one or more columns of a table to ensure the
                    uniqueness of each record.</p>

        <div class="question-container">

            <div class="answer">
                <p><b>The UNIQUE constraint in SQL ensures that all values in a column are distinct (unique).</b> It is
                    similar to the PRIMARY KEY constraint but allows for NULL values in the column (excluding the unique
                    constraint).</p>

                        table.</b> It establishes a link between the two tables, creating a relationship. The FOREIGN

            <div class="answer">
                <p>A Self-Join is a specific case of a SQL join where a table is joined with itself. It is used when a
                    table has a hierarchical structure or when it contains a foreign key that references its own primary
                    key. In a self-join, you need to use table aliases to differentiate between the two instances of the
                    same table.</p>

                <p>A Cross-Join, also known as a Cartesian Join, returns the Cartesian product of the two tables

                    table, resulting in a large result set. Cross-Joins are not commonly used in practice due to their
                    potential to generate a vast number of rows.</p>

                <p><b>An Index is a database object that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table.</b> It is created on one or more columns of a table. Different types of indexes include:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Non-Clustered Index: Does not alter the physical order of the table, and it uses a separate

                    <li>Unique Index: Ensures that the indexed columns contain unique values.</li>

                <p>The main difference between a Clustered and Non-clustered index lies in the way they store and

                <ul>
                    <li>Clustered Index: Determines the physical order of data rows in a table. The table can have only
                        one clustered index, and the data rows are sorted based on the key values. It directly affects
                        the order of the data on disk.</li>
                    <li>Non-Clustered Index: Does not alter the physical order of the table. It uses a separate
                        structure to store index data, and the data rows are stored in a different order. A table can
                        have multiple non-clustered indexes.</li>

                <p>In SQL, UNION, MINUS, and INTERSECT are set operations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>UNION:</strong> Combines the result sets of two or more SELECT statements, eliminating duplicate rows.</li>
                    <li><strong>MINUS (or EXCEPT):</strong> Returns the rows that are present in the first result set but not in the second result set, eliminating duplicates.</li>
                    <li><strong>INTERSECT:</strong> Returns the common rows between two result sets, eliminating duplicates.</li>

            <div class="answer">
                <p>In SQL, a cursor is a database object used to traverse the result set of a query. Cursors provide a way to iterate over the rows of a result set one at a time.</p>
                <p>Usage of a cursor involves the following steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Declare a cursor.</li>
                    <li>Open the cursor.</li>
                    <li>Fetch rows from the cursor one by one or in a bulk.</li>
                    <li>Close the cursor when done.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <pre><code class="sql">DECLARE cursor_name CURSOR FOR
        SELECT column1, column2
        FROM your_table;

        FETCH NEXT FROM cursor_name;

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>One-to-One (1:1):</strong> Each row in the related table is related to only one row in the main table.</li>
                    <li><strong>One-to-Many (1:N):</strong> Each row in the main table can be related to multiple rows in the related table.</li>
                    <li><strong>Many-to-One (M:1):</strong> Multiple rows in the main table can be related to one row in the related table.</li>

            <div class="answer">
                <p>In SQL, an alias is a temporary name assigned to a table or column for the purpose of a query. It is used to make the column or table names more readable or to provide a different name.</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <pre><code class="sql">SELECT column1 AS alias_name

            <div class="answer">
                <p>Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves breaking down large tables into smaller ones and defining relationships between them.</p>

            <div class="answer">
                <p>Denormalization is the process of intentionally introducing redundancy into a database by combining tables. This is done to improve query performance at the cost of some redundancy and potential update anomalies.</p>

            <div class="answer">
                <p>OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) is a type of data processing that manages transaction-oriented applications. It is characterized by a large number of short online transactions, such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations. OLTP databases are designed for real-time data processing and are optimized for quick and accurate transaction processing.</p>

            <div class="answer">
                <p>OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) is different from OLTP in terms of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> OLTP is used for transactional processing, while OLAP is used for analytical processing and reporting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Database Design:</strong> OLTP databases are normalized, and OLAP databases are often denormalized for faster query performance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Operations:</strong> OLTP involves simple CRUD operations, while OLAP involves complex queries and aggregations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Freshness:</strong> OLTP requires real-time data, while OLAP deals with historical data and is not concerned with real-time updates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Concurrency:</strong> OLTP systems handle a high level of concurrent transactions, while OLAP systems are typically read-intensive with fewer concurrent updates.</li>

                <p>Collation refers to the set of rules that dictate how characters are sorted and compared in a database. Different types of collation sensitivity include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Case Sensitivity:</strong> Determines whether uppercase and lowercase letters are treated as distinct. Examples include case-sensitive and case-insensitive collations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accent Sensitivity:</strong> Determines whether accented characters are treated as distinct from their non-accented counterparts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kana Sensitivity:</strong> Relevant in Japanese collations and determines whether Kana characters are treated as distinct from their Romanized counterparts.</li>
